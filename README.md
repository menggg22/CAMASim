# üõ†Ô∏è CAMASim
A comprehensive tool for evaluating CAM-based CIM accelerators  for both chip-level performance and application accuracy with hardware constraints.

CAMASim is a Easy-to-use, Modular and Extendible package of simulating CAM-based CIM accelerators along with lots of core components layers which can be used to easily build custom search schemes. You can use it with any CAM-compatible applications with cam.write() and cam.query().

## Quick Start
### Get the tool from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/menggg22/CAMASim.git
```
### Dependencies

### Run examples
The examples/ folder contains example on HDMANN.

## Integrate in your own applications

- Step 1: Prepare stored data *CAM_Data* and query data *CAM_Query* in your application

- Step 2: modify config file *cam_config* and load config
- Step 3: Initialize *CAMASIM* class with config
- Step 4: Simulate **write** opeartion on *CAM_Data* 
- Step 5: simulate **query** opeartion *CAM_Query* 

```
# Step 2 Example
import yaml

def load_config():
    script_path = os.path.abspath(__file__)
    script_dir = os.path.split(script_path)[0]

    with open(script_dir + "/cam_config.yml", "r") as f:
        config = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
    return config

## Step 3-5 Example
from CAMASim.CAMASim import CAMASim

def simCAM(CAM_Data, CAM_Query):
    cam_config = load_config()
    cam = CAMASim(cam_config)
    cam.write(CAM_Data)
    CAM_pred_ids, _, _ = cam.query(CAM_Query) # Accuracy Evaluation
```
