## What is this?
- The tool provides a Python interface for easy integration with popular Python-based ML platforms.
- Application-specific data and search operations are used as input for architecture modeling and FoM evaluation
- Functional simulation is conducted to generate CAM outputs for analyzing application accuracy
- Architectural modeling is performed for chip-level FoMs and built on top of the previous circuit-level EvaCAM tools that support different underlying CAM designs.
